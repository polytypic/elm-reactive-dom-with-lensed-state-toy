## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polytypic/elm-reactive-dom-with-lensed-state-toy.git
cd elm-reactive-dom-with-lensed-state-toy.git
elm-reactor
```

```bash
open http://localhost:8000/Main.elm
```

## WTF?

This is a **_toy_** example meant to illustrate how one can create composable
components using reactive dom and lensed state.  This is absolutely not a
serious implementation of the approach.
